# Kasper's Cookiecutter for new Python projects

Using [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html) to create project templates with all the boilerplate already added.

## Using this cookiecutter

Make sure `cookiecutter` is installed on your system:

```shell
pip install cookiecutter
```

Now, use this template to generate a new project with all the needed files.

```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/KPLauritzen/cookiecutter-python.git
```

Just fill in the details in the prompt.

That's it. Now go hack up something fun!

## Setting up your project

There is an autogenerated README in your new project folder, but here is also a list of commands to get you started:

```shell
cd <project_name>
python -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
git init
pre-commit install
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Test your project

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest
docker build --target=test -t <project>-test . && docker run <project>-test
```

## TODO

- Add GitHub actions
  - On this repo to test cookiecutter baking
  - On template to run tests on PRs etc.
  - Docker build
- Add list of features to the top of this README.
- Consider using [directories](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/directories.html) to further customize templates. Eg
  - deployable webapp w Zappa
  - Azure DevOps pipelines
- Use [templates in context values](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/templates_in_context.html) to ensure correct naming.
